			However, tax saving investments can also help you meet your long term financial goals
			like retirement planning. If you look at the various investment options under Section 80C,
			you will observe that many of these investments are meant to serve your retirement planning needs
			in addition to tax savings. Employee provident fund, public provident fund, life insurance policies
			(both traditional and unit linked), National Pension Scheme and mutual fund Equity Linked Savings
			Schemes are all investments in Section 80C that are in some ways or other associated with long term
			financial planning, either in rhetoric or results.
			
		  	<br><br>

			Unfortunately in our country, retirement planning is not given the due importance that it deserves.
			Over the years, employee provident fund, public provident fund and traditionally life insurance policies
			have been the investment options, commonly associated with retirement planning in India. All these
			investments are seen as risk free investment, and retirement planning as such in India is usually
			associated with these investments. As far as retirement planning is concerned there is a thumb rule
			called the 30 – 30 rule. The 30 – 30 rule in very simple terms means that you have 30 years of working
			life, in which you have to save and invest enough to provide for 30 years of retirement. The rule sounds
			simple and obvious. So what is the big deal? Let us walk through an example with numbers and hopefully
			you will understand that, it is not as easy as it sounds. Let us assume you are 30 years old. You will
			retire at 60. Your current income is र 10 lacs per year. Let us assume that, your basic salary is 50%
			of your gross salary (it is usually in the 40% to 50% range). You contribute 12% of your basic salary
			to Employee Provident Fund. Your employer makes a matching contribution. In addition, let us assume
			you will save another 10% of your gross income for retirement planning. Let us further assume that
			you get a salary increment of 10% every year. The chart below shows how much you will save till your
			retirement.

		 <div class="p_subtitle">
			   So What is the solution
		 </div>
			
		<p class="article_card_text">
			 You can save more towards retirement. However, you will agree with me that it is easier said than done.
			 Inflation, home loan EMIs, children’s education and marriage, and last but not the least, taxes consume
			 a big chunk of our incomes and leave less for savings. If you are a big spender, maybe you should try to
			 save more but if you are judicious spender already, saving more towards retirement is not always feasible.
			 The solution lies in getting better returns on your retirement planning investment and that is the crux
			 of this blog post. If instead of 8% returns you get 15% returns, your retirement corpus will last for
			 around 20 years instead of 7 – 8 years. Is it possible to get 15% return on your investment? Some of my
			 relatives and friends asked me, can they get 12% guaranteed returns? The 10- year Government Bond yields
			 over the last 10 years average around 8% return. If the Government of India cannot guarantee an average
			 more than 8%, maybe a few basis points here or there, how can you expect to get more than that in risk
			 free guaranteed returns? In fact, if you look at all risk free 80C investment options, the maximum return
			 is 8.7% (except for special 80C investments for the girl child and senior citizens where the interest is
			 9.2 – 9.3%).

			  <br><br>			  
			So we come back to the question, is it possible to get 15% return on your investment? The answer is yes, but not without taking risks. Mutual Fund equity linked savings schemes (ELSS) have given excellent returns over the long term. SIPs in top performing ELSS funds have given around 20% or more compounded annual returns (based on yesterday’s NAVs) in the last 15 to 20 years. You should note that mutual fund investments, including ELSS are subject to market risks. The last 10 year period in equity markets included three bear markets, in 2008, in 2011 and in 2015 – 2016. Therefore, the last 10 years, by no means, represent a dream run for equities. However, even in the last 10 years, monthly SIPs in top performing ELSS funds gave nearly 15% returns (based on yesterday’s NAVs), despite the challenging conditions. The performance of ELSS over the last 10 years speaks to the fact that, equity is the best asset class to create wealth in the long term for investors, irrespective of the interim periods of volatility.

			Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS)
		</div>	
		<p class="article_card_text">
			  
				ELSS is a mutual fund equity scheme that qualifies for tax savings under Section 80C up to
				a limit of र 150,000. An ELSS is essentially a diversified equity scheme with a lock in period
				of three years from the date of the investment. Capital gains in ELSS are tax exempt.
				Dividends paid by ELSS are also tax free. If you invest in an ELSS through a systematic
				investment plan (SIP), each investment will be locked in for 3 years from their respective investment dates. Compared to other retirement planning investments under Section 80C, ELSS offers higher liquidity and potentially superior post tax returns. However, as with all mutual fund investments ELSS are subject to market risk. ELSS funds have given an average of 16% trailing annualized returns over the last 3 years and 12% annualized returns over the last 5 years. Top performing ELSS funds have given 25% and 19% annualized over the last 5 years. Whether we take the average or top performer returns, either ways, they are much higher than the returns of any of the risk free 80C investment options.
				Even if we compare the ELSS returns with National Pension Scheme returns, ELSS beats NPS on
				a pre-tax basis. A major advantage which ELSS enjoys over NPS is the tax treatment on maturity.
				While capital gains in ELSS are tax free, NPS maturity amount is taxable on withdrawal, subject to
				taxation norms for NPS.

		 <div class="p_subtitle">
			   Why is ELSS the best tax saving investment to create a retirement corpus over a long investment horizon?
		  </div>	
		<p class="article_card_text">
		
			  Let us see how much wealth could have created in the last 15 years from FY 2001 to FY 2015 by
			  investing in ELSS or Equity Linked Saving Scheme versus a risk free investment like PPF. We have
			  considered PPF as our 80C risk free investment, since it beats all other risk free 80C investments
			  in terms of interest rate and tax treatment. PPF like ELSS, from a tax standpoint is what is known
			  as E-E-E (Exempt – Exempt – Exempt). E-E-E means that investment is exempt from tax at the time of
			  investment, during the tenure of the investment and on maturity. For our analysis we have assumed an
			  annual investment of र 70,000 in FY 2000 – 2001, र 100,000 from FY 2001 – 2002 to FY 2013 – 2014 and
			  र 150,000 in FY 2014 – 2015, as per Section 80C limits for the respective years. Let us first see how much maturity amount one would have accumulated in the last 15 years by investing up to the maximum 80C investment limit in PPF. The chart below shows the cumulative deposit amount and value of the investment in PPF.
			  The blue line shows the cumulative deposits made by the investor in his or her PPF account every year.
			  <br><br>
		 </p>
		
		<div class="col-md-12 center">
        			<img src="{% static  'images/start-early-sip3.png'  %}" class="articlecardimage"/>
    	</div>
		
		<p class="article_card_text">
			 The total deposit made by the investor is र 15,20,000 (र 15.2 lacs) over the duration of the PPF.
			 The maturity amount of the investor is about र 29,82,000 (around र 29.8 lacs).
			 <br><br>
			 Let us now see how much corpus would an investor have accumulated by investing up to the maximum 80C
			 investment limit in ELSS. In this example, we have chosen an average ELSS fund which completed 15 years.
			 The chart below shows the cumulative investment amount and value of the investment in ELSS. The blue
			 line shows the cumulative deposits made by the investor in the ELSS fund every year. The orange line shows the value of the ELSS investment based on prevailing NAVs.

		  <div class="col-md-12 center">
        			<img src="{% static  'images/start-early-sip2.png'  %}" class="articlecardimage">
		   </div> 

	  <p class="article_card_text">
			   The total investment made by the investor from 2000 – 2015, is र 15,20,000 (र 15.2 lacs),
			   the same amount deposited in PPF in the previous example. As we can see from the chart above,
			   the ELSS returns are of a very different order of magnitude compared to PPF. In fact, the current
			   value of the first two ELSS investments made in 2000 and 2001 itself is much more than the total
			   maturity amount accumulated in PPF in the previous example. The value of the ELSS investment as on
			   Apr 2, 2015 is over र 1.15 crores, nearly four times the PPF maturity amount. Will the current market
			   downturn affect the value of ELSS investments? We had discussed, ELSS is a market linked investment;
			   the value of your ELSS investment will be affected by the market performance. In the last one year Nifty
			   is down almost 14%. If we assume the performance of your ELSS investment to reflect market performance in the last one year, then the value of your investment may be down to slightly less than र 1 crore, but still it is many times higher than the PPF corpus with the same investment..

	  <div class="p_subtitle">Conclusion:</div>
	  <p class="article_card_text">
		  We had discussed a number of times on our blog that, asset allocation plays the most important role
		  compared to a multitude of other factors, in how much returns you get from your portfolio in the long
		  term. Equity is undoubtedly the most desirable asset class for young and earning investors. As such ELSS
		  is one of the best investment options not only for tax saving but for
		  retirement planning also under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, as far as young and earning
		  investors are concerned.
