							  Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) is a term that now has a very familiar ring to it with every salaried
			person in India. However, some critical aspects of this important investing mode are still not well
			understood.

			Overall, the larger fund houses have done an excellent job in promoting the concept of disciplined investing
			in the form of SIPs through billboard, television and print advertising. We strongly advocate this for folks
			who don &#39t have time to research about stocks and stock market movements. In fact, a SIP negates all the
			short-term volatilities in the market in the form of Rexit, Brexit etc. If you don &#39t know what Brexit is,
			google it now! In this article we describe the use of SIPs and how starting a SIP early provides you with
			a jump-start for creating long term wealth

			  "Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful" is quite a popular
			  Warren Buffet quote. In essence it means one needs to think against the crowd to generate above
			  normal returns from the stock market. The chart shown below is the plot of Sensex performance over
			  the last 10 years.

			  It is very clear that there are cycles of intense buying (extreme optimism) followed by a cycle of
			  intense selling (extreme pessimism) denoted by areas marked in red in the chart above. An example
			  of extreme pessimism was just after the 2008 global financial crisis and an example of extreme optimism
			  is after Prime Minister Narendra Modi got elected.  It is extremely difficult to time the market entry
			  and exit. This is where SIP comes into play. As we invest a fixed amount irrespective of market
			  conditions our returns will be averaged over the SIP period. Thus the time one remains invested
			  in the market becomes more important than timing the market. A SIP is similar to the adage
			  "Heads I win, Tails I don&#39t lose much"..

				   Starting Early
			  </div>	
		  <p class="article_card_text">
		  Ok, we hope that you are convinced about SIPs (else write to us!), but the key is to start as early as possible. Remember the formula we learnt in school on Compounding? Let me remind you again!
		  <br><br>
		  <strong>A = P *(1+r/100)n</strong><br>
Where:<br>
A is the Amount you get after  &#39n&#39 years<br>
P is the initial investment or  &#39Principal&#39<br>
r is the rate of return<br>
n is the number of years<br>
<br>
				As you can see, the amount grows "exponentially" with the number of years of investment.
				Albert Einstein famously said that "Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world.
				He who understands it, earns it ... he who doesn &#39t ... pays it." (we all know that he was smart,
				so we should just listen to what he said!). If you are just starting your career, this formula should really excite you as there are many years left to compound before you retire. Let &#39s take a simple example to illustrate this:
	  <br><br>
		  <strong>Situation A</strong> is that you start investing  &#8377 10,000 monthly towards a SIP in equity mutual funds, from the age of 35 till you retire at say 60 years. In this situation, assuming 12% annualized equity returns, you will retire with a corpus of  &#8377 1.70 Crores. 
<br><br><strong>Situation B</strong> is that you start investing just half of the amount in Situation A, that is  &#8377 5,000 towards a monthly SIP in the same funds, but start earlier from the early age of 25 till you retire at 60 years. Do you know what corpus you will retire with in Situation B at the same assumed 12% annualized equity returns? That number will be  &#8377 2.76 Crores, much higher than situation A!
<br>

<div class="p_subtitle">Growing SIP:</div>
		  <p class="article_card_text">
Along with duration, it is also important to understand the need to increase your SIP amount every year. Having a constant SIP does not do enough to adjust for inflation and quality of life. If your salary is expected to grow, and your lifestyle will improve, then let &#39s understand that inflation will eat into that as well! Let &#39s consider another simple example to illustrate this:
Situation A: is that you start investing a fixed amount of  &#8377 5,000 towards a monthly SIP in equity mutual funds, from the age of 25 till you retire at say 60 years. In this situation, at 12% annualized equity returns, you will retire with an expected amount of  &#8377 2.76 Crores. 
Situation B: is that you start investing  &#8377 5,000 monthly SIP in the same funds from the age of 25 till you retire at 60 years, but you grow your investment amount by 10% every year (that is, your first 12 monthly investments are SIP amounts of  &#8377 5000, the next 12 monthly investments are SIP amounts of  &#8377 5,500, the subsequent 12 monthly investments are SIP amounts of  &#8377 6,050 and so on). 
Do you know what corpus you will retire with in Situation B at the same 12% annualized equity returns? The number will be  &#8377 7.88 Crores, almost three times that of situation A! It &#39s incredible what time does to such an incremental increase in monthly investments.

</div>
 <div class="p_subtitle">Goal-based SIPs and Inflation:</div>
		  <p class="article_card_text">
The best way to make a financial investment through SIPs is to define a goal with target corpus amount, and estimate by when you need it. Let &#39s say you need to save  &#8377 10 lakhs for your children &#39s higher education in 10 years from now. How much should the SIP be? 
For this you also need to understand what the same amount would be in 10 years &#39 time, adjusted for inflation. Assuming 6% annual inflation,  &#8377 10 lakhs in 10 years will only be worth  &#8377 5.6 lakhs in today &#39s value. So to counter inflation, you will actually need to target a corpus of  &#8377 18 lakhs after 10 years, which is equivalent to  &#8377 10 lakhs in today &#39s value with inflation, and then calculate the required SIP amount.
To achieve the goal of  &#8377 18 lakhs after 10 years, you will need to invest a constant monthly SIP of approx.  &#8377 8,100. However, with a SIP growing annually at 10%, you can achieve the same goal with a starting monthly investment of just  &#8377 5,600!
<br><br>
</p>
 <div class="p_subtitle">Key Takeaway:<div>
		  <p class="article_card_text">
Don &#39t start investing with a random SIP amount, Understand, Quantify and Prioritise your goals first. Calculate the SIP amount for each goal and required % yearly increase required in SIP to see where you stand. Work towards increasing your SIP amount by cutting down on wastages, negotiating a better pay and leveraging your other talents for additional sources of income. And then just SIP away to glory!
