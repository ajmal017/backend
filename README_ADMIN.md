# IMPORT IFSC

An empty/filled id row is necessary while importing the IFSC data from the csv.
The format of csv header will be

id, name, ifsc_code, bank_branch, address, phone_number, city, district, state


# VERIFIABLE PINCODE TRANSFER

As the amount of data is very large in this case. The user can experience a little lag/delay during filter process.
